# TANK-JavaClient
Java Client for TANK

## Disclaimer ##
Do not use this client in production !!  
If you do decide to give it a spin, please remember that:  
1. It _will_ burn your toast in the morning  
2. It _will_ cause a total irrecoverable outage on your neighbour's wide screen tv  
3. Your morning coffee will taste worse. However your evening tea might actually taste "fuller"...  

*You have been warned.*

If you ignore my warnings and use it anyway, then, just FYI,  
I didn't actually code this, I just found it on my computer,  
Well actually it wasn't even my computer, it was a friend's computer,  
Or a friend's friend's other friend's dog's computer.  
Oh and btw, my name is actually James, so this Robert person you are looking for, he is not me,  
he must be someone else, and...   
What are we talking about ? Tank ? is that some kind of armored vehicle game ?  
Sounds pretty cool.  

## Usage ##

## Status ##
It doesn't do shit.
